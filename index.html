            Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake
            recipe! Paired with a buttery graham cracker crust, no one can deny
            its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water bath.

              <li>3 large <strong>eggs</strong>, at room temperature</li>

                  Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat
                  oven to 350°F (177°C).

                 <strong>Make the crust: </strong>Using a food processor, pulse the graham
                crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar
                and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all
                together in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press
                firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or
                10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use
                the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly.
                Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot
                pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around
                the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly
                cool as you prepare the filling.

                <strong>Make the filling: </strong>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a
                paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar
                together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture
                is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream,
                vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined.
                On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each
                addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated
                into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake
                from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the
                batter as best you can.

                <strong>Prepare the simple water bath (see note) </strong>Boil a pot of water.
                You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water
                bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of
                hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil
                around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of
                the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an
                even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan.
                Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the
                oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then
                pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)

                Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost
                set. When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly
                wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open
                the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in
                the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven
                and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room
                temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4
                hours or overnight.

                Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the
                springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife,
                cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife
                clean and dip into warm water between each slice.
